# TLA Second Project
In this repository I have 3 different projects for TLA(Theory of Language and Automata course) that are implemented in C#.  
# Grammar
In the first question (Q1 file), we try to get a grammar as input and a string to check. Then by applying grammar rules try to find if the string is acceptable or not by the grammar. If the input string is accepted, then print "Accpected", and if not, print "Rejected".  
Input format is as follows:  
1. In the first line, we get an integer of n that determines the number of variables in the grammar.  
2. In the next n lines, in each line, we get a rule of that grammar. Variables are wrapped by <>, # stands for nullablle transition and different rules separated by |.  
3. In the last line, we get a string to check.  

One pair of input and output:  
Input:  
3  
&lt;S&gt; -> a&lt;S&gt;b | a&lt;A&gt; | b&lt;B&gt;  
&lt;A&gt; -> a&lt;A&gt; | #  
&lt;B&gt; -> b&lt;B&gt; | #   
aaab  
Output:  
Accepted  
# PDA
In the second question (Q2 file), I've implemented a calculator using PDA (Pushdown Automata). The calculator has these opertors: +, -, *, /(, ), ^, sqrt, sin, cos, tan, abs, exp and ln. Input is only a string to be calculated and the output will be the answer with 2 decimal numbers or "INVALID" if the input is invalid.  
One pair of input and output:  
Input:  
sin(ln(5 ^ 6 * 3 - cos(sin(6))))  
Output:  
-0.97  
# Turing machine
In the third question (Q3 file), we get a turing machine and some strings to check that the machine accept it or not.  
Input foramt is as follows:
1. In the first line, we get a string of combination of 0 and 1 that coded a turing machine. Initial state of machine is 1, final state is 1^(numberofstates) and blank is 1.
2. In the second line, a positive integer of n that shows number of strings to check will be represented.  
3. In the next n lines, we get an string in  each line.  
The output will be n line that each line shows "Accpeted" if string accepted by the machine and "Rejected" if it's not.
